# Text-Editor
I am attempting to make a fully functional text editor using pure **C** (without any depedencies).

## Status : { 🚧 On Halt for now }

# NOTE : 🧐
although the editor is under construction but still if you think of some feature that you wish to see in the editor then feel free to open an issue saying " _I would love to see ```<this feature>``` in this text editor_ ".
