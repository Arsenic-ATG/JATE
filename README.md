insipred from [kilo text editor](https://github.com/antirez/kilo)

## Status : üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è under construction 
- editor can view a file and supports navigation via arrow keys (editing is not suported till now)

## Platform supported 
Linux, macOS, windows(with cygwin)

## Get it running 

- git clone or download 

- navigate to the repostiroy 

- run a `make` command on your terminal to compile source ( if you don't have cmake then you can also manually compile the source code (src/editor.c) with a standard C compiler )

- run exectuatable with the name `editor` 


```bash
$ cd text-editor
$ make
$ ./editor
```
